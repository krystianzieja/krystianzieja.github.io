Microsoft releases Windows Server 2016 in three major versions: Datacenter, Standard and Essentials.
Essentials is edition dedicated for small businesses with maximum of 25 users and 50 devices.
Microsoft recommends Windows Server 2016 Essentials for those who are using Windows Server 2012 Foundation, because Microsoft did not released Foundation edition in Windows Server 2016 product line.

Most companies will choose between Standard and Datacenter edition.
In respect to virtualization Datacenter edition offers unlimited virtualization rights,
where Standard edition is restricted to running two virtual machines (obviously in Standard edition we can stack up licenses and run more virtual machines on single server). However the virtualization
rights is not the only difference between Standard and Datacenter editions.
The following table summarizes the most important distinctions between those two versions.
